Here are some training materials to get started with Dojo Ajax Toolkit.
The idea is to have a series of lessons in different areas which are organized by level of difficulty.

Each lesson have four parts;

1. Description and reference
2. Working sample code
3. Exercise
4. Solution ot exercise

Each part should be as small as possible, but no smaller. Two-three paragraphs of description is perfect, for example.
