This exercise shows how to split up custom Dojo widgets into base- and sub-classes.

1. Check out the sample code and make sure you understand how it works. It uses just one custom dialog widget.
2. The exercise uses a custom widget which has the former widget as a superclass and overrides one of its functions ('_onOkClicked')
3. Override the event handler for the cancel button as well, and make sure you log something different.
4. (Optional) Copy the tempalte file from the base widget to the subclassed widget and modify it. make sure you override and change the 'templateString' property in the subclass.
