This is a very simple exercise where one learns how custom widgets works in Dojo.
Good walkthrough can be found here: http://dojotoolkit.org/documentation/tutorials/1.6/recipes/custom_widget/

The Exercise is as follows;

1. Open and study the file Sample/sample.html
2. Note that it creates a new custom widget and places it under an existing DOM node using its 'domNode' property and the standard appendChild DOM function.
3. Create several new custom widgets of the same type, either using the same method or using a loop.
4. Use the browser debugging tool of your choice to observe the automatic id's given to certain DOM nodes
