This is a very simple exercise, where everything is just loaded into one page. No custom widgets and no 20-page magic incantations merged into html pyramids the size of Kebnekajse.
The idea is to show in just a page, how dojo is loaded and use the 'dojoType' property to instantiate widgets. Alla widgets can also be created programataically, but the markup way is also useful, for small pages.

c. http://download.dojotoolkit.org/release-1.6.1/dojo-release-1.6.1/dijit/tests/form/test_Slider.html

Exercise;

1. Look at the Sample page and understand how it works
2. Go to the exercise page and add the property 'dojoType="dijit.form.HorizontalSlider" ' to the div with id="slider1" under the input node with id="mydate"
3. (Optional) Go crazy and check out the source of the page in reference (c) to get inspiration to other changes and additions.
