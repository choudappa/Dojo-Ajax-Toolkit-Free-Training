In this example, the sampe has been partially converted to use a datagrid to present the data in the html page.

The datagrid needs a separate layout object that defines how it should represent the properties in the data it reads.
The layout object declares each of the columns in the grid, and a column definition might look like this;

{
'name': 'Column 1',
 'field': 'id',
 'width': '100px'
}

The field property must match a property name in the data objects and the name property is the label of that grid column.
The exercis is as folow;

Rewrite the 'layout' objct in the foocombo.js class so that it uses the data properties defined in the exercise.html file.
